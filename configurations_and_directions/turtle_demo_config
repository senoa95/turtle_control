Base Station Network Config:

Necessary components:
1. PC with 2 or more ethernet connections and access to WiFi
2. Ubiquity M5 antenna
3. Monitor (duh!)
4. Router

Configuration:
 
1. Connect PC to WiFi with access to the internet.
2. Connect one ethernet connection on PC to internet input on router. Configure this as "Shared to other computers" in IPV4 settings.
3. Connect second ethernet connection to LAN input on router. Configure this as "Manual" in IPV4 Settings. Set a static IP address. Set the address of the router as Gateway and DNS. Open "Routes" and select "Use this connection only for resources on its network". 
4. Configure the base station Ubiquity antenna as:
	pc ip_address = 192.168.1.103
	ubiquity ip_address = 192.168.1.200
5. I still do not know how to configure the PC as a static ip so I am simply using another computer in order to serve as a base station with static ip.
